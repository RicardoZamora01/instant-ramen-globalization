                <p className="text-white">
                    Instant noodles have penetrated the global market and became one of the most successful industrially produced foods.
                    This should not come as a surprise since they are mass produced using inexpensive ingredients that are widely acceptable:
                    wheat, vegetable oil, and assorted flavorings, including salt, monosodium glutamate (MSG), a form of protein essence,
                    sugar, and other flavorings based on local tastes. Thus, instant ramen corporations have proven their success by distributing
                    their products all over the world.

                    <h2 className="text-2xl pb-4"><strong>Nestle's Maggi Instant Noodles</strong></h2>

                    The first manufacturer of instant noodles in the Pacific Island was Nestlé. Consequently, Maggi instant noodles 
                    from Nestlé were shipped to Papua New Guinea. The strategy employed by Nestlé was to market inexpensive, instant 
                    ramen to the most underprivileged members of society. This inexpensive and cost-effective solution has become a 
                    replacement for many urban Papua New Guineans.
                    As mentioned in <i> The Noodle Narratives: The Global Rise of an Industrial Food into the Twenty-First Century, </i> 
                    instant noodles have assimilated into the culture and are a part of daily life.  
                    The authors state <q>from cradle to grave: babies are often weaned with instant noodles and elders are celebrated 
                    in death rituals with instant noodles as elements in ceremonial exchange</q>(7) as a way to depict how drastic of a change there 
                    was after this introduction of a new, inexpensive product. In other words, Papua New Guineans have incorporated the noodles
                    into rituals as cardinal as weaning babies and honoring the dead. 
                    Over time, Nepal, Bangladesh, Singapore, New Zealand, and Malaysia all saw a rise in popularity for Maggi instant noodles.

                    <h2 className="text-2xl pb-4"><strong>Maruchan Instant Noodles</strong></h2>
                    Instant noodles were first distributed in Mexico in the 1980s. Despite the presence of numerous rivals in the mid- to late 1980s, 
                    Toyo Suisan's Maruchan continued to make significant investments in the Mexican market even after businesses like Nissin 
                    withdrew during the crisis of 1994. As a result, Maruchan has gained widespread recognition among Mexicans to the point 
                    where it is now used as a shorthand for instant noodles. Their quickness and low cost contributed to their increase in 
                    popularity. In Mexico, the majority of the workforce (almost 60%) makes less than $13 per day. It is therefore not surprising 
                    that many working Mexicans consume a stomach-filling substance that costs just 7 to 10 pesos (about 50 cents in USD). Maruchan 
                    took full advantage of this and produced a variety of delicious flavors for the locals. I can say with pride that Mexicans 
                    have adopted this meal into their culture by fusing it with their own customs and adding their distinct identity to the mix.

                    <h2 className="text-2xl pb-4"><strong>Instant Noodles Suppressing Hunger</strong></h2>

                    All corporations mentioned above share common values -- to provide inexpensive, nutritional, tasty, and belly-filling meals 
                    that allows consumers to quickly make a meal for themselves. Many chronically cashconstrained members of the working class rely
                    on instant noodles to surpress the aching feeling of persistent hunger. It's worth noting that underdeveloped nations are not the 
                    only ones who rely on quick noodles. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that people in the United States depend substantially on 
                    these meals, either as a means to salvage agency or as an escape from perpetual hunger. For instance, the authors of
                    <i>The Noodle Narratives: The Global Rise of an Industrial Food into the Twenty-First Century</i> spoke with several college students 
                    who value reducing expenses and are heavily reliant on this product in order to avoid going without food for extended periods of time.
                    They also highlighted that some Latinx persons were raised in working-class homes, where parents often worked long hours to support 
                    their families and had little time to prepare meals.

                    
                    A quote that stuck with me in the book was, 
                    
                    <q>the price did matter to me when I ate instant noodles; the price of anything I purchase matters to me because I am not a man of great wealth.</q>(83)
                    
                    This remark struck a chord with me because I have clear memories of nights when my parents lacked the resources or time to prepare a complete dinner, 
                    so we would make do with a tasty Maruchan with lemon and spicy sauce. My brothers and I frequently would just have to eat instant noodles to stay filled 
                    since they would frequently arrive home from work too fatigued to make dinner or they would arrive extremely late at night.

                    It's also crucial to keep in mind that many of those who mainly rely on instant ramen are people of color who lack the resources, finances, and/or time
                    to cook and consume a full meal.

                    When asked about Japanese food, the majority of people can often name more popular or expensive foods like sushi, kaiseki, or Wagyu beef.
                    This piece also aspires to demonstrate that not all Japanese food is upscale and costly. In terms of how significant of an influence it has 
                    had on the world, instant ramen most definitely flies under the radar. As I've documented on this website, Japanese food is much more than 
                    high-end cuisine, and it has a significant cultural and economic effect across the world.

                    <br /><br />

                    As a matter of fact, many of the leading noodle companies and organizations joined forces to form the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA), 
                    an organization that strives to enhance quality so that consumers all around the world may eat instant noodles with comfort.

                    In the aftermath of natural catastrophes, WINA has been involved in emergency food relief. 
                    WINA provides emergency rations of instant noodles to those in disaster-stricken areas.
